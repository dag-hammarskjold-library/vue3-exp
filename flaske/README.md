### ME3-alpha Flask version

Currently serves a static page with one main Vue component and several subcomponents. 

The REST API ([DLX-REST](https://github.com/dag-hammarskjold-library/dlx-rest)) must be running on localhost:5000  in order to interact with the API. Therefore this app must be started on a different port, i.e. `flask run --port 8000`
